Climate analysis is crucial for understanding climate patterns and variations in a region over time. Google Earth Engine offers a powerful platform for processing and analyzing geospatial data, enabling detailed climate analyses that help in:

Understanding and predicting climate phenomena
Making informed decisions about natural resource management and environmental planning
Monitoring climate change and its impacts
Tools and Concepts
This repository uses the following concepts and tools to perform climate analysis:

Google Earth Engine: A cloud platform for processing and analyzing geospatial data from satellites, radar, and other sources.
Accumulated precipitation: The total amount of precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) recorded in a specific period (year or month).
Average monthly precipitation: The average precipitation recorded in each month over several years.
Temperature analysis: The study of minimum, average, and maximum temperatures in a region over time.
Climogram: A graph that shows the average monthly precipitation and temperature of a region throughout a year.
Water balance (P-ET): The difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET), indicating the availability of water in the soil.
